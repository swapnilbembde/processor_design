Project1 contains a	 16-bit	 very	 simple	 computer	 developed	 for	 the	
teaching	 purpose.	 The	 IITB-RISC is	 an	 8-register,	 16-bit	 computer	 system.	 The	 architecture	is well optimized	 for	 performance.

Project2 contains a	6	stage	pipelined	processor,	IITB-RISC,	whose	instruction	set	architecture	is	provided.		
IITB-RISC is	a	16-bit	very	simple	computer	developed	for	the	teaching	purpose.	The	IITB-RISC is	
an	 8-register,	 16-bit	 computer	 system.	 It	follows	 the	 standard	 6	 stage	 pipelines	
(Instruction	fetch,	instruction	decode,	register	read,	execute,	memory	access,	and	write	back).
